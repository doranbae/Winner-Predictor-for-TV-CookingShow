# Predicting winner with Deep Learning (Keras)
Using Keras, I built neural network to predict NBH winners. 
## Keras is an easy-to-use & powerful library
This was my first time trying out Keras (instead of my go-to TensorFlow). In the past, I have read multiple times Keras was easier, but I just never got around trying out Keras. After fiddling with the library for 20 minutes, I said to myself, "I am never going back."
